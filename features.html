        <h1>Roadmap (with rough timelines, 2019)</h1>
        <h4>Product goals for year 2019</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>OpenCHS is focused on the use case where the primary user is in the field provides services or collecting data. OpenCHS doesn't aim to be a platform for data management for users who are well connected to the Internet - this is well served space and there are platforms that do this already (Salesforce, Liferay, React Admin, Django) and some under works (Google App maker). But the programs that are field based, often have supplementary use cases like a call center user who calls the clients, on-behalf data entry users who fill in for busy users (e.g. doctors in PHC) or data entry to be done in bulk because it is too difficult to capture data when service is being provided (e.g. mass height/weight capturing activities. But these user/use-cases are as much part of their core program - which primarily field based.</li>
            <li>Standing up a new implementation and then running the program, requires a lot of specialised knowledge of OpenCHS. Hence these activities are dependent on availability of OpenCHS product team. In 2019, the goal is make the implementation easier via web interface and support self-serviceable by the using organisation themselves.</li>
            <li>Upto 2018, OpenCHS has followed the model which was centered around an individual (aka beneficiary, client) and all data is captured for it - enrolment, encounter, program encounter. In 2019 - we aim generalise Individual to Subject, allow multiple subject types and link subjects of different types to each other.</li>
            <li>Improving the existing features of the product based on user feedback.</li>
        </ul>


        <h3>App</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="#subject-linking" class="feature-item">Link subjects of two different types (April)</a></li>
            <li>Ongoing improvements based on user feedback</li>
        </ul>
        <div id="subject-linking" class="mfp-hide white-popup">
            <h3>Link subjects</h3>
            <p>Best understood via an example - if an implementation has two types of subject - Anganwadi and Beneficiary, then capture beneficiary list while filling Anganwadi VHND form or vice-versa.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Web interface</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Self-management of users (March)</li>
            <li>Catchment and location hierarchy management (May)</li>
            <li>Data collection (May)</li>
            <li>Privilege based access to data (July)</li>

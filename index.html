                <h1>Our Goal</h1>
                <p>OpenCHS aims to be a comprehensive community health platform designed to empower health workers with supportive supervision of the clinicians.
                It is being developed in collaboration with practitioners working in the field with large experience in community medicine.</p>
                <p>OpenCHS team started work on it in the second half of 2016. The first feature being developed is a decision support platform customisable for
                    the health workers in the field.</p>

                <h1>Demo</h1>
                <p>Download the Android App  <a href="/openchs.apk">here</a> and install it. You may need to allow your device to accept download from unknown sources if you haven't done already.</p>
		<p>After installation completes tap on the top left icon. Update the url to <a href="http://server.openchs.org/openchs/fs">http://server.openchs.org/openchs</a> if it is different. Tap new settings button to get synchronise and get the latest configuration.</p>
		<p>The the module installed is designed for users who use Marathi, so some of the english translations may be off.</p>
                <h2>Key Technologies</h2>
                <h4>Mobile</h4>
                <p>Even though web view kind of interface on mobile have come a long way they still do not match native app experience, especially on low end devices in trying
                    conditions. We chose React Native because it is easy to learn, speeds up development cycle and will allow us to peform play store less upgrade.</p>
                <p>We are using Realm as our offline database.</p>

                <h4>Infrastructure</h4>
                <p>We are managing our infrastructure using docker (honestly, most of work right now has been on mobile side)</p>

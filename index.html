                <h1>Our Goal</h1>
                <p>OpenCHS aims to be a comprehensive community health platform designed to empower health workers with supportive supervision of the clinicians. It is being developed in collaboration with practitioners working in the field with large experience in community medicine. </p>
                <p>OpenCHS is designed to be used by field and primary level health workers, from any android device. OpenCHS is a generic platform meant to be used by health workers for multiple health programs (mother, child growth, chronic diseases etc), in multiple languages and can be configured for the needs of specific organisations. It can be used during screening, follow-up care and surveys. The app also provides basic and simple algorithmic decision and other job related support for health workers e.g. identification of high risk pregnancies, child growth monitoring via WHO growth charts, immunisation/vaccination/visit schedule management, dosage calculation, etc.</p>
                <h5>Health modules along with the platform</h5>
                <p>OpenCHS team is also working on developing health modules as per India's national and WHO health guidelines. These health modules are also open source and can be readily used. The modules for which version have been developed are: mother (ANC, Delivery and PNC), child (growth monitoring) and outpatient module (dosage calculation). One can choose the health modules provided by the OpenCHS team or develop their own.</p>

                <h3>Demo</h3>
                <p>Please follow the instructions <a href="https://openchs.readme.io/v1.0/docs/setting-up-of-mobile-client">here</a> for downloading the demo version of the app.</p>
                <br/>

                <h3>Key Technologies</h3>
                <h5>Mobile</h5>
                <p>Even though web view kind of interface on mobile have come a long way they still do not match native app experience, especially on low end devices in trying conditions. We chose React Native because it is easy to learn, speeds up development cycle and will allow us to perform play store less upgrade. We are using Realm as our offline database.</p>
                <h5>Server side</h5>
                <p>We are using Java, Spring, Hibernate and Postgres.</p>
                <br/>

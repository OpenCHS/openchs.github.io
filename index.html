        <h2>OpenCHS demo is down. The individual registration is not working after the sync. We will fix it on Monday</h2>

        <h1>Our Goal</h1>
        <p>OpenCHS aims to be a comprehensive community health platform designed to empower health workers with supportive supervision of the clinicians. It is being
            developed in collaboration with practitioners working in the field with large experience in community medicine. </p>
        <p>OpenCHS is designed to be used by field and primary level health workers, from any android device. OpenCHS is a generic platform meant to be used by health
            workers for multiple health programs (mother, child growth, chronic diseases etc), in multiple languages and can be configured for the needs of specific
            organisations. It can be used during screening, follow-up care and surveys. The app also provides basic and simple algorithmic decision and other job related
            support for health workers e.g. identification of high risk pregnancies, child growth monitoring via WHO growth charts, immunisation/vaccination/visit
            schedule management, dosage calculation, etc.</p>
        <h5>Health modules along with the platform</h5>
        <p>OpenCHS team is also working on developing health modules as per India's national and WHO health guidelines. These health modules are also open source and can
            be readily used. The modules for which version have been developed are: mother (ANC, Delivery and PNC), child (growth monitoring) and outpatient module
            (dosage calculation). We are currently working health modules for - adolescent continuum of care. You can find out about other modules on the <a
                    href="https://openchs.mingle.thoughtworks.com/projects/openchs">roadmap</a>. please One can choose the health modules provided by the OpenCHS team or
            develop their own.</p>

                href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.openchsclient&hl=en">playstore</a> to get a feel of OpenCHS. The reporting dashboard for OpenCHS
